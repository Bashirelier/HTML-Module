	<h2>Climate Change</h2>
	<p>Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.<br>The rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport.<br>
	When these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.<br>The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.</p>
